[0.03 - 12.38]  Genshin Impact is still one of the most popular gacha games out there, with millions of players logging in daily to explore Teyvat, pull for new characters, and grind for artifacts.
[27.54 - 38.02]  But let's be honest, the game feels a bit stale sometimes. Recycled events, predictable banners, and the lack of endgame content leave many players feeling burned out.
[38.41 - 61.30]  And with more competition rising, games like Wuthering Waves and Zenless Zone Zero creeping closer, what if Genshin loses its magic? What if one day the servers just shut down? Why are artifact drop rates still this bad? Farming for the perfect stats feels like a never-ending curse, and don't even get me started on the resin cap.
[61.30 - 77.50]  But hey, Fontaine's story has been incredible. The lore, the characters, the music, HoyoVerse still knows how to deliver jaw-dropping experiences when they really try. And who saw the Arlecchino buffs coming?
[77.50 - 105.57]  She went from mid to absolutely cracked. They actually listened for once. Who knew that was possible? But the monetization, the insane paywalls, like the overpriced skins, sometimes it feels like Hoyoverse just sees us as walking wallets, and that is honestly disgusting. But hey, NatLan is coming. New region, new characters, and hopefully some fresh mechanics.
[105.57 - 110.14]  Maybe, just maybe, Genshin is about to reach peak hype again.
