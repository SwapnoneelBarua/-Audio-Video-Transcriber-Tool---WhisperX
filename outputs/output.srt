What is this African tribe actually hiding?

2
00:00:02 --> 00:00:10
So in the desert of Mali, Africa, Western Africa, there is this tribe called the Maasai that has never been visited by the outside world.

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:19
There was originally one, but eventually two British anthropologists in the early 1980s who were fascinated by this tribe.

4
00:00:20 --> 00:00:27
They went and met them, but what they were so fascinated by was that their tribe had all these incredible stories.

5
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
about their history and their heritage that they wouldn't tell them.

6
00:00:30 --> 00:00:39
They wanted to know this incredible history because they had all these orbital tracks of stars and stuff and things that they should not have known.

7
00:00:40 --> 00:00:49
For generations they used these drawn in sand symbols and tracks to measure the sunrise so they could hide for this gigantic werewolf creature.

8
00:00:49 --> 00:00:54
Before approaching the village these anthropologists snuck in a secret camera

9
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
and recorded their interaction.

00:00:56 --> 00:01:00
The BBC posted it on TikTok, but they removed it.
